To create a Cloud Storage infrastructure on GCP that stores a customer's company database, you can follow these general steps:
Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
    Enable the Cloud Storage API for your project.
        Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store your data.
            Set up access control to manage who can access your data.
                  Configure lifecycle management to automatically delete or archive data that is no longer needed.
                        Set up versioning to keep multiple versions of your data.
                              Use Cloud Storage Transfer Service to move data from other storage providers to your Cloud Storage bucket.
                                     Monitor and manage your Cloud Storage usage and performance.
